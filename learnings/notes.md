* Was hooks was encouraging me to pass method to alter state into a presentational component?

* TypeScript is amazing to be able to define a language for adding types to objects with arbitary keys. E.g.
  the type declaration of `onChange: <K extends keyof Address>(field: K, value: string) => void;`  means `field` must
  be a key in the interface `Address` enabling type checking on `onChange("suburb", value);`. TypeScript will show type
  error if field is not a key of `Addresss`, e.g. ` onChange("xxx", value);`.

* TODO: how do I apply generics to values types

* This list of DOM events from dom-testing-library is very nice https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/blob/master/src/events.js

* For some reason HTMLFieldSetElement.elements isn't defined in this jsdom. Looks like I'm using the correct version
```bash
    $ grep version node_modules/jsdom/package.json 
      "version": "14.1.0",
```
- Let's delete `node_modules/jsdom` to verify this is version used.
- Aha! Test still runs. Someone must be pulling in old version of jsdom as yarn.lock has entry for `jsdom@^11.5.1:`
- Cool yarn has a command to show dependency tree
```
  $ yarn why jsdom
  ...
  => Found "jest-environment-jsdom#jsdom@11.12.0"
  info This module exists because "react-scripts#jest#jest-cli#jest-config#jest-environment-jsdom" depends on it.
```
- Looks like jest-environment-jsdom is stuck on jsdom 11.12 https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7926
- Okay looks like I can install an alternative jest-environment-jsdom
- Bah! Looks like I can't use alternative 
```
  package.json
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "jest-environment-jsdom-fourteen"
  }
  
These options in your package.json Jest configuration are not currently supported by Create React App:

  â€¢ testEnvironment
```
- Actullay jest-environment-jsdom-fourteen was already included as dep of create-react-app. To enable it I need to use
the `--env=jest-environment-jsdom-fourteen`. I need to add this to IntelliJ Jest run configurations well. 
```
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jest-environment-jsdom-fourteen",
```
- Can't use jest.config.js either. Looks like it's ignored.
* **LEARNING:** `String.replace()` only replaces first match if match parameter is a string. Use RegExp match with 
global flag to replace all ocurrances.
```
> "1 2 3".replace(" ", "-")
'1-2 3'
> "1 2 3".replace(/ /g, "-")
'1-2-3'
```

* **LEARNING:** *Testing*: react-test-renderer to quite useful testing onChange handlers as it allows an easy way to get the
on change handler.
Example:
```javascript 1.8
  const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(<BusinessCardForm {...businessCard} onChange={handleChange} />);
  const testInstance = testRenderer.root;

  testInstance.findAllByType(TextField).forEach((field: any) => {
    field.props.onChange(`A ${field.props.label} value`.toLowerCase());
  });
```

* If I keep FormField private I'll going to need to duplciate tests for rendering of validation error. I really don't
want to expose FormField as I prefer people to use the specific field components. Duplicate tests for now.
  - Slept on it and came up with solution where FormFied is exported in thin wrapper that only functions outside of 
  production
  ```typescript jsx
    export const FormFieldForTesting: React.FC<FormFieldProps> = props => {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
        throw new Error("FormFieldForTesting is only for unit testing FormField behvaiour.")
      }

      return <FormField {...props} />;
    };
  ```
  
* Oooo interesting challenge. By implementing a simplistic trimming of whitespace on field input I can no longer type 
in space, i.e. `onChange={event => props.onChange(event.target.value.trim())}`
  * First solution which comes to mind is for trimming to take place onBlur

### React Hooks
* Wow it was really easy to switch from class `this.state` to `useState()` just needed to use the following declaration
`const [state, setState] = useState({` then drop `this.`.

* **LEARNING:** To only have state set once from props use `useEffect()` hook which is equivalent to `componentDidMount()`

* Interesting error when using PhoneField with local state, e.g. 
  ```
    const [value, setValue] = useState();
    ... 
    <PhoneField
      label="Postcode"
      value={value}
  
  index.js:1375 Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input of type tel to be controlled. Input elements 
  should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled (or vice versa). Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled 
  input element for the lifetime of the component. More info: https:/k/fb.me/react-controlled-components
  ```
  * Why is it considering that PhoneField is used as an uncontrolled input now?
    * This is because value is initialy defined before it is set in `useEffect()`
 
 * Interesting issue now where state is read before it has been set.
   ```typescript jsx
          setValidationMessage("error");

          if (validationMessage === undefined) {
            props.onChange(postcode);
          }
   ```
   * `validationMessage` doesn't have the new value "error" yet so `props.onChange` will be called.
   * How do I test for this?
